# Quantitative Math Learning Portfolio
This repository documents my study journey to prepare for a  master's degree in quantitative finance and to pursue a role as a quant trader or analyst.

## Objective
My goal is to enhance my understanding of mathematics and programming, focusing on the skills needed for a career in quantitative finance and quantitative trading.
