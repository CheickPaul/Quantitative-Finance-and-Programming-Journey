# Quantitative-Finance-and-Programming-Journey
This repository documents my self-study journey to prepare for a top-tier master's degree in quantitative finance and to pursue a role as a quant trader in elite trading firms.

## Objective

- Rebuild a strong foundation in mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, probability)
- Master programming with Python and OCaml, especially for algorithmic thinking
- Gain deep insights into quantitative finance and machine learning applications
- Track and document my progress in a clear, structured, and transparent way

## Repository Structure

- **Phase1/**: Review of core mathematics (precalculus, algebra, brain teasers)
- **Phase2/**: Intermediate theoretical development (analysis, statistics, game theory)
- **Phase3/**: Advanced topics in finance, pricing models, and ML for trading
- **Programming/**: Python and OCaml projects for data and trading
- **Certificates/**: Official certifications demonstrating acquired skills
